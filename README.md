Abstract

Optimally locating warehouses and stockpiling necessary relief supplies prior to a catastrophe, as well as appropriately distributing relief supplies among affected people following a catastrophe are among the most crucial logistical tactics to enhance performance and decrease delays in responding to a disaster. In this respect, this research develops a multi–period multi–product mixed–integer non–linear programming model in a three–level network including suppliers, warehouses, and affected areas. The proposed model strives to minimize deprivation cost while maximizing demand coverage and fair service. In particular, perishability of relief supplies, a restricted budget for establishing warehouses and procuring supplies with its gradual injection into the project, lateral transportation before a catastrophe, and time value of money are considered to develop the model. In addition, a bidirectional quantity flexibility contract (BQFC) considering the potential of delayed and installment payments, two–part buybacks, and quantity–based discounts on its terms integrated with multi–sourcing is proposed to provide the required relief supplies at pre–disaster phase. The applicability and performance of the model are validated via a real case study in Mashhad, Iran. Various sensitivity analyses are provided to achieve helpful managerial insights.
